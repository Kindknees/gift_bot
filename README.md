The detailed report is in [LineBOT final project.pdf](./LineBOT%20final%20project.pdf)

## 📌 Introduction
A LINE bot designed to help users find the perfect gift for any occasion. Whether it's a birthday, year-end gift exchange, or Valentine's Day, our bot provides thoughtful recommendations based on recipient details.

## 🎯 Motivation
Finding the right gift can be challenging. Questions like:
- "What should I get for Guanghan's birthday?"
- "What kind of gift would be suitable for my boss?"
- "Valentine's Day is coming up, what would my partner like?"

Inspired by these common dilemmas, we developed a **LINE BOT Gift Recommendation System** to assist users in selecting thoughtful presents.

## 🔍 Features
- 🎁 **Personalized Gift Recommendations**: Suggests 3-5 suitable gifts based on input parameters.
- 📝 **User Preferences Input**: Users specify recipient's **age, gender, personality, and gift purpose**.
- 🎉 **Surprise Easter Eggs**: Fun keyword responses to engage users.
- 📩 **Seamless LINE Integration**: Simple QR code scan to add the bot and start using it instantly.

## 🛠️ How It Works
### Step 1: Provide Recipient Details
Users enter:
- Relationship with recipient (friend, family, partner, etc.)
- Occasion (birthday, anniversary, holiday, etc.)

### Step 2: Select Age & Gender
- **Age groups:**
  - A: 15 and below
  - B: 16-29
  - C: 30-59
  - D: 60 and above

### Step 3: Choose Personality Type
Users can specify a gift style:
- 🎨 **Aesthetic Type**: Stylish, artistic, and trendy gifts
- 🛠 **Practical Type**: Useful items that add value to daily life

- 💡 **Creative Type**: Unique and innovative gifts

### Bonus: Easter Egg Keywords 🎊
Certain keywords trigger special responses, such as:
- **"Music"** 🎶 → Shares a recommended song link
- **"New Year"** 🎆 → "Finals aren't over yet QQ"
- **"Valentine's"** 💘 → "Don't think too much, you don't have one."
